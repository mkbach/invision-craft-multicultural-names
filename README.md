# Multicultural Names For inVision's Craft Plugin

This project was born out of the need to help designers and developers use a diverse range of names in their workflows. The users we design for aren't only named Tiffany, Lisa, Joe, John. They are also named Shamika, Le, Mohammed, Lakshmikantan, YiÄŸit. 

Here are reasons why you should use multicultural names in your designs:

**Ethical Reasons**
- Account for diversity among users of your products
- Promote an inclusive culture within companies and with stakeholders
- Gain empathy for your users
  
**Technical reasons**
- Realistic name field lengths
- Account for different types of names

## Groups of Names
- Female
- Male
- Trans and Non-Binary (Coming Soon)

## Names from these countries and cultures are represented:
- African
- American
- Arabic
- Chinese
- Egyptian
- French
- German
- Indian
- Israeli
- Japanese
- Korean
- Mexican
- Russian
- Scandinavian
- Spanish
- Turkish
- Vietnamese

## We need your help
Please help make these lists more inclusive by submitting names you believe should be in here. I am also looking for help with Trans and Non-Binary names.

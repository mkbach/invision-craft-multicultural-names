# Multicultural Names for inVision's Craft Plugin

Are you tired of using the same old names in your designs as placeholders? Todays products are designed for a global audience, so designers should start using names from other parts of the world. This will help make the designs feel more realistic. Using multicultural names also test your designs. Can your designs handle longer names or are you only designing with John Doe in mind?

Craft - The InVision plugin for both Sketch and Photoshop has a great feature called Type. Designers can now use real content as placeholders instead of the standard Lorem ipsum. The ability to create a custom list of content you use is pretty awesome as well. Seeing this functionality helps fill the gap of having quick access to multicultural names when designing. 

I have gathered a list of female and male names from various parts of the world for you to add to inVision's Craft plugin. The names are Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, African, Israeli, Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, Scandinavian, German, Mexican, French, Spanish and American.

## We need your help
Please help make these lists more inclusive by submitting names you believe should be in here. I am also looking for help with Trans and Non-Binary names.
